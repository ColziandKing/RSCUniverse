# RSCUniverse✡️
Finally, the time has come to put it all in one inventory. The time of collection for all of my creation, many histories and many more for my cost. I have made countless repositories of coding, now not about coding. The production of my stories are made many ideas from curiosity and inspirations, also everday may not be a new idea but every day I think for more content to expand this wonderful world.

I also have ideas that are not used in the RSCU but used for different media outside the franchise.
